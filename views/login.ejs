          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name is Kewaun Cain. Being raised in the foster care system, I understood the systematic disadvantages that prevent youth from accessing resources available to them. During high school, I traveled across the country to speak with Foster Parents and Foster Agencies to bring awareness to these challenges. With this movement we signed the Foster Care Bill of Rights. My drive to assist others in navigating the world has fueled me to work alongside those in the system along with organizations whoâ€™s goals align with mine.  </p>
